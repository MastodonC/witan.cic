# Remove Unmodelled Episodes

## Context

The raw episodes data contains UASCs which are not included when considering budgetting for CiC and children in "respite care", who's care is intermittent and difficult to include in modelling.

## Decision

We want to remove UASCs and children with V3 and V4 legal statuses.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

UASCs, V3s and V4s are removed from the episodes data.
