# Projection the Children in Care Population

## Data

Using the SSDA903 following data is extracted for each episode, across multiple calendar years.

* Sex
* Category of need
* Legal status
* Year of birth
* Episode report date
* Episode report year (financial)
* Episode ceased date
* Placement
* Unique psuedominised ID

## Psuedominised data

To ensure protection of sensitive personal data an ID lookup is used by the Local Authority, so that whilst the model can match different episodes to an individual there is no additional personal data to enable reidentification.

Whilst individuals need to be aged, date of birth was considered too sensitive, so year of birth is used to roughly assign ages.
